GOAL: CREATE A DEEP LEARNING MODEL FOR CLASSIFYING HISTOPATHOLOGICAL IMAGES OF LUNG AND COLON CANCER.

This project will help Oncologist in cancer diagnosis by providing a well-trained model to detect cancer using pictures of 2D histological microscopy tissue slices, stained with different stains, and landmarks denoting key points in each slice. 
DataSource: Kaggle

This project consists of 3 files.
1) Data Precossing -> Preprocess the image data for making it compatible to use with Model.
2) Baseline Model  -> Acts as a starting point to building CNN model and provides idea of how a basic model would perform on this dataset
3) CNN Model -> Final CNN model, which is trained and tested for classification task, achieving a high accuracy of 89.5%.
